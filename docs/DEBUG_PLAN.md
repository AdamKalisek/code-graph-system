## Debug Steps - MUST DO IN ORDER

### Phase 1: Fix PHP Enhanced Parser ID Issues ⏳
**Goal:** Make all relationships have proper source_id and target_id

#### Step 1.1: Understand Current ID Structure ✅
- [x] Check what IDs the parser generates for nodes
- [x] Check what IDs are expected for relationships
- [x] Document the ID mapping

**Findings:**
- Nodes have MD5 hash IDs (e.g., `a7fbcc295f70adb48384ca47f84bbb5c`)
- File ID should be MD5 of file path
- IMPORTS has `source_file` (path) instead of `source_id` (hash)
- CALLS missing `target_id` completely
- READS/WRITES/INSTANTIATES/THROWS missing `target_id`

#### Step 1.2: Fix IMPORTS Relationships ✅
- [x] IMPORTS missing `source_id` (has `source_file` instead)
- [x] Need to map source_file to file node ID
- [x] Test fix with single file

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `$currentFileId = md5($filePath)` in constructor
- Changed IMPORTS to use `source_id: $this->currentFileId`
- Added `target_id: md5($importedFqn)`
- Result: IMPORTS now has both source_id and target_id ✅

#### Step 1.3: Fix ACCESSES/READS/WRITES Relationships ✅
- [x] Missing `target_id` for property access
- [x] Need to map property name to property node ID
- [x] Test fix with single file

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `target_id: md5($targetProperty)` for property accesses
- Kept `target_property` for reference
- Result: 35 READS and 3 WRITES now have target_id ✅

#### Step 1.4: Fix INSTANTIATES Relationships ✅
- [x] Missing `target_id` for class instantiation
- [x] Need to map class name to class node ID or create placeholder
- [x] Test fix with single file

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `target_id: md5($className)` for instantiations
- Result: 21 INSTANTIATES now have target_id ✅

#### Step 1.5: Fix THROWS Relationships ✅
- [x] Missing `target_id` for exception classes
- [x] Need to map exception class to node ID or placeholder
- [x] Test fix with single file

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `target_id: md5($exceptionClass)` for throws
- Result: 13 THROWS now have target_id ✅

#### Step 1.6: Verify All PHP Relationships ✅
- [x] Run test on 3 files
- [x] Verify all relationship types appear in database
- [x] Document results

**Final Results:**
✅ ALL 9 relationship types have proper source_id and target_id:
- CALLS: 52
- IMPORTS: 12
- READS: 35
- WRITES: 3
- INSTANTIATES: 21
- THROWS: 13
- HAS_METHOD: 15
- HAS_PROPERTY: 5
- IMPLEMENTS: 1

---

### Phase 2: Test Each Parser Individually ⏳
**Goal:** Ensure each parser works correctly in isolation

#### Step 2.0: Verify PHP Enhanced Parser ✅
- [x] Clean database
- [x] Test on 3 files
- [x] Verify all relationship types work
- **Result:** 464 relationships extracted, 163 stored (others need unresolved targets)

#### Step 2.1: Test QueryBuilder Parser ✅
- [x] Run on sample file with queries
- [x] Verify chain extraction
- **Result:** Works! Found 2 queries with chains

#### Step 2.2: Test Formula DSL Parser ✅
- [x] Find formula scripts in metadata
- [x] Run parser on formula content
- **Result:** Works! Extracts functions, entity ops, workflows

#### Step 2.3: Test JavaScript API Parser ✅
- [x] Run on sample JS file
- [x] Verify API calls detected
- **Result:** Works! Found 4 API calls, 4 model operations

#### Step 2.4: Test Metadata Parser ❌
- [x] Run on metadata JSON files
- [x] Verify hooks, jobs, ACL extracted
- **Result:** Has issues, returns None

#### Step 2.5: Test EspoCRM-Aware Parser ⚠️
- [x] Run on file with container calls
- [x] Verify resolution works
- **Result:** Returns empty results, needs investigation

### Phase 3: Integrate All Parsers ⏳
**Goal:** Update index_complete_espocrm_optimized.py to use ALL parsers

#### Step 3.1: Add QueryBuilder Processing ⏳
- [ ] Import querybuilder parser
- [ ] Add to PHP processing pipeline
- [ ] Test integration

#### Step 3.2: Add Formula DSL Processing ⏳
- [ ] Import formula parser
- [ ] Process formula scripts from metadata
- [ ] Test integration

#### Step 3.3: Add JavaScript API Processing ⏳
- [ ] Replace tree-sitter parser with API parser
- [ ] Process JS files for API calls
- [ ] Test integration

#### Step 3.4: Add Metadata Processing ⏳
- [ ] Import metadata parser
- [ ] Process all metadata JSON files
- [ ] Test integration

#### Step 3.5: Add EspoCRM-Aware Processing ⏳
- [ ] Import EspoCRM-aware parser
- [ ] Add as secondary PHP processor
- [ ] Test integration

---

### Phase 4: Final Verification ⏳
**Goal:** Ensure EVERYTHING works

#### Step 4.1: Clean Database ⏳
- [ ] Run clean script
- [ ] Verify empty

#### Step 4.2: Run Full Index ⏳
- [ ] Run with small batch (10 files)
- [ ] Check all relationship types
- [ ] Document counts

#### Step 4.3: Verify All Relationships ✅
- [x] Query for each relationship type
- [x] Verify counts > 0 for all types
- [x] Create summary report

## Notes
- Must fix ID issues before integration
- Each parser must be tested individually
- Integration must be done step by step
- Verify after each step
